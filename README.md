NetworkAnomalyzer

Computer networks are constantly subjected to attacks which can effectively cripple a business' ability to function. Cyber attacks are hard to detect but are also costly to miss.

This project uses anomaly detection, in particular novelty detection, to alert network administrators and security experts when a network is potentially under attack. The dataset used is the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CICID S2017).

The dataset represents 3 days worth of network traffic activity, 2 days of which included the following cyber attacks: Brute Force, Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).
